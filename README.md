# TSMAccountingManager

A Python app to organise, and check all your accounting export from Trade Skill Master in WoW

The idea behind this app is to be able to input the accounting data exported from the TradeSkillMaster desktop app, and to be able to visualize the different gains/losses per categories. This is inspired from Samadans [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Na0cF8p91g), but eased up by using python. 

I am working on this from time to time so i won't be advancing on it really fast. Contributions is appreciated, even if it is only in the form of advice or remarks!
